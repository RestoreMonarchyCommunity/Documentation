## About Plugin
This plugin allows you to steal items from players. To do this, use the animation "Point" and keep the sight for a certain time on your target.

## Features
• Let your players steal items from others instead of killing.   
• Pickpocket must hover the cursor on the victim as long as it’s configured to rob him.  
• Manage who can rob and who cannot be robbed with permissions.  
• You can set an alert for the police in the config, if pocket theft was committed.
